# Midimutant

This repo currently contains a circuit based on [this design posted on Silicon Stuff](http://siliconstuff.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/serial-port-midi-on-raspberry-pi.html) 
for using the Raspberry Pi built in uart as a midi output.

# Setting up midi on the Raspberry Pi

The files in boot need to go in /boot (probably good idea to compare
with existing rather than copying them over). The relevant part of
config.txt is:

    lcd_rotate=2
    dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
    init_uart_clock=39062500
    init_uart_baud=38400
    dtparam=uart0_clkrate=48000000

Build and install ttymidi - this is adapted to allow sysex messages to
pass through correctly.

    $ cd pi/ttymidi
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

# Autostarting Midimutant on Raspberry Pi

Based on LXDE window manager 

1. Copy midimutant.desktop to /home/pi/Desktop 

This tells the window manager how to start the application.

2. Create a local startup for the pi user by copying contents of
  dot-config to .config in /home/pi 

This autostarts the application and a terminal in the background so
you can still plug in a keyboard and alt-tab to it to escape the
fullscreen app.

3. Copy midimutant.sh to /home/pi 

This is the shell script that starts ttymidi, connects it to the
output alsa midi device and starts midimutant.

To make the application fullscreen with no window decoration, add this to
/home/pi/.config/openbox/lxde-pi-rc.xml in the <applications> section:

    <application name="midimutant">
     <decor>no</decor>
     <shade>no</shade>
     <focus>yes</focus>
     <fullscreen>yes</fullscreen>
     <maximized>true</maximized>
    </application>

4. Turn off the mouse pointer

Doing the properly for touchscreen was tricky to figure out (unclutter etc show the mouse when it moves). Edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf search for the xserver-command option and uncomment it to be this:

    xserver-command=X -nocursor
