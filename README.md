# Midimutant

This repo currently contains a circuit based on [this design](http://www.instructables.com/id/PiMiDi-A-Raspberry-Pi-Midi-Box-or-How-I-Learned-to/)
for using the Raspberry Pi built in serial uart as a midi output. It
uses an adapted ttymidi that allows sysex messages through (to be
added asap).

Also contains files for construction of the enclosure for use with an
official Raspberry Pi touch screen.
